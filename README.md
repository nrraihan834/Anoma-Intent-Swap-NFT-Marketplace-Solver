🔮 Anomix Intent – Swap & NFT Marketplace Solver

A prototype frontend submission for ANOMA INTENTS TUESDAY: REDUX.
This project showcases an intent-centric dApp where users can submit swap or NFT marketplace intents, and simulated solvers respond with offers in real-time. It’s designed to highlight multi-chain user experience improvements and intent-driven flows.

✨ What’s Changed

Enhanced with a clean React-like vanilla JS frontend (no build needed).

Two major flows:

Token Swap Intents

NFT Marketplace Intents

Dynamic dropdowns with popular tokens and top NFT collections.

Simulated solver network that processes intents, generates offers, and displays them in a modal.

Accept/Decline flow with mock transaction IDs and results logging.

Team footer + social links for contributors.

🎉 Why It Matters

The Anomix Intent prototype demonstrates how intent-centric applications can anticipate user needs rather than just executing commands. By abstracting complexity, it improves the multi-chain UX and showcases the vision of Anoma:

“The best intent-centric solutions don’t just solve problems—they predict them.”
